AutomaticUpdatesIntoFeatureService
==================================

This Python script turns grabs a point location from an external site which is constantly updating. It parses the feature and pushes submits an updated point to an ArcGIS.com feature service. A feature service with proper schema must already exist for this script to work correctly.

See more information on the [associated ArcGIS Blog post](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/...).

## Instructions

1. Download the update.py and settings.ini files. (Hint: Click the `Download ZIP` button on the right)
2. Save these files to your local working directory
3. Setup a feature service with your ArcGIS.com account. The instructions [on this blog post](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/09/22/how-to-create-a-hosted-feature-service/) explain the different ways. The required feature service for this example is simple, as such the first option of creating a service from ArcGIS Online would be straight forward. 
3a. From **My Content**, click **Create Layer**.
--1. Select from a URL to a feature layer
--2. Enter:  http://services1.arcgis.com/hLJbHVT9ZrDIzK0I/arcgis/rest/services/issSchema/FeatureServer/0
--3. Select next, accept the default extent and enter some useful tags and summary information on the final page. Remember the title, you'll need to enter this information into the Python script.
--4. Click done.
--5. Set sharing options for the service. You **do not** need to enable editing.
4. Edit the Python script you saved previously and update the variables at the top of the script. 
5. Run the script. As-is, it'll update the point every 5 minutes. Modify this value to your needs.
